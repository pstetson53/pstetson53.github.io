Welcome to my website. My name's Philip. I'm:

* a mathematician
* a computer programmer
* a proof-relevant/homotopy-coherent scientist.


What I do, in more detail:

##### pure mathematics

I study derived algebraic geometry and its applications to programming language theory and string theory.

##### computer programming 

I am a kind of full-stack developer that uses proofs to understand code and vice versa. I study and encode certified compilers that prove useful theorems w.r.t. a variety of programming problems and (relatively valid) scientific experiments.

##### proof-relevant/homotopy-coherent science

I design certified compilers which compile and deploy formally verified artificial intelligence. One of the founding principles of this science is that experimental findings are recorded coherently as (X: theorem, Y: proof of X). Via this identification, we can mine the "theorems of the universe" by running computer programs using (at least relatively valid) experimental data.
