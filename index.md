Welcome to my website. My name's Philip. I'm:

* a mathematician
* a computer programmer
* a proof-relevant/homotopy-coherent scientist.


In detail:

##### pure mathematics

I study derived algebraic geometry and its applications to programming language theory and string theory. Essentially, I'm trying to understand spectral algebraic geometry from the POV of derived algebraic geometry dually higher algebra in hopes that we can have a fully synthetic theory of homotopy types (and homotopy type theory) using local systems.

##### computer programming 

I am a kind of full-stack developer that uses exactly proofs to understand code and vice versa. I research and encode certified compilers that prove useful theorems w.r.t. a variety of programming problems and (relatively valid) scientific experiments. For example, check my open source MMP program on github.

##### proof-relevant/homotopy-coherent science

Informally, in this science, experimental results are recorded as a pair (X: theorem, Y: proof of X) and identified (via another proof) only up to homotopy-coherence. This way we can effectively mine new-theorems of the science and naturally make connections with other fields. The end goal of implementing this science into computer systems is to have certified compilers which compile and deploy formally verified artificial intelligence, with clear learning goals and boundaries. This kind of science has a natural piece of automatic discovery and is completely epistemologically lucid.
