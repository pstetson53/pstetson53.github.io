## intro

Welcome to my website. My name's Philip. I'm:

* a mathematician
* a computer programmer
* a proof-relevant scientist.

Here's an overview of what I research, in more detail:

### pure mathematics

I study derived algebraic geometry with applications to programming language theory and string theory.

### computer programming 

I aim to build certified compilers that help prove theorems w.r.t. programming problems and (relatively valid) scientific experiments.

### proof-relevant science

I design certified compilers which compile and deploy formally verified artificially intelligent systems. Through this effort, all of human scientific knowledge can become "proof-relevant" and therefore computable, coherent, and completely lucid.
