## intro

Welcome to my website. My name's Philip. I'm:

* a mathematician
* a computer programmer
* a proof-relevant scientist.


My interests, in detail:

##### pure mathematics

I study derived algebraic geometry with applications to programming language theory and string theory.

#### computer programming 

I program and model certified compilers that help prove theorems w.r.t. a variety of programming problems and (relatively valid) scientific experiments.

#### proof-relevant science

I design certified compilers which compile and deploy formally verified artificial intelligence. This effort aims to unify all of human scientific knowledge, creating a "proof-relevant" and therefore computable, coherent, and completely lucid epistemological environment for researchers.
